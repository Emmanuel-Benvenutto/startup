This Project aims to show how basic features that Google and Youtube platforms offers to us, can be implemented in our Web site to interact with elements such as videos, playlists, uploads, subscriptions and more.

To make this application, has been used the "Youtube API v3", which offers many features we use every day in Youtube platform, in combination of "Auth2 API" which is needed to facilitate access to Youtube API v3. Both Apis were controlled and managed by the "API Client Library for Javascript" that Google offers developers to interact with other compatible Apis of Google.

To perform functions, the user must be logged in with an enabled Google Account. The application provides a login for this task, which allows any user to log in with differents Google Accounts.

Once logged in, the user can perform a search of videos of his choice and see their possible results. By selecting a particular result, the application will allow us to play the selected video embedded in our Web site, without the need of been redirected to the oficial Youtube Website. Likewise, some related information are showed, such as the title, description, Likes and views.

Another important feature is to work with a local Playlist. The user can create a new Playlist with its own name and description, which can be filled in with some videos of their choice and removed if desired as well. All this information will be persistent with Local Storage, so that the user can continue working with the same list if the browser is closed.

In â€œMy Channel" section, the user can see information related to his Channel, such as Playlists, his Subscriptions and his Uploaded videos. Every element can be selected to show further information. All pages use responsive design and can be runned in differents browsers, such as Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer and mobiles.

Finally, the application should allow to save the new Playlist created into Youtube (done), as well as their videos contained in it (pending).
